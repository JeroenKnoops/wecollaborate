## State of the project

We're [currently working on 1.0.0](https://github.com/gregbell/active_admin/issues?milestone=18),
which as far as dependencies, moves us from meta_search to Ransack and adds Rails 4 support.
Until it's ready, you can get Rails 4 support today by tracking master:

```ruby
gem 'activeadmin', github: 'gregbell/active_admin'
```

The plan is to follow [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) as of 1.0.0. The 0.6.x line will
still be maintained, and we will backport bug fixes into future 0.6.x releases. If you don't want
to have to wait for a release, you can track the branch instead:

```ruby
gem 'activeadmin', github: 'gregbell/active_admin', branch: '0-6-stable'
```

## Goals

1. Allow developers to quickly create gorgeous administration interfaces __(Not Just CRUD)__
2. Build a DSL for developers and an interface for businesses.
3. Ensure that developers can easily customize every nook and cranny of the interface.
4. Build common interfaces as shareable gems so that the entire community benefits.
