## Goals

1. Allow developers to quickly create gorgeous administration interfaces __(Not Just CRUD)__
2. Build a DSL for developers and an interface for businesses.
3. Ensure that developers can easily customize every nook and cranny of the interface.
4. Build common interfaces as shareable gems so that the entire community benefits.

## Rails 4

There isn't yet an official release that supports Rails 4. For now, you'll have to use master:
```ruby
gem 'activeadmin', github: 'gregbell/active_admin'
```
